Here, we made a virtual machine in Azure studios in order to connect to our ticketing system on Remote Desktop Connection and to also connect to our installation applications while connecting to the ticket itself.

After creating our virtual machine and connecting/logging in to our Remote Desktop Connection, we anbled the CGI feature under Application Development Feature; and after that step was completed, we go to a search engine and type 127.0.0.1 which activates and installs our Internet Information Services to ultimately connect to our ticketing system.

After we made sure our Internet Information Services was working, we went ahead and installed the PHP Manager for IIS and is one of the required software to install to use/connect our ticketing system.
